# Some things noticed during the competition: 
1- UserWarning: KL divergence is starting to become negative: -5.62 - this might be a precursor for failed training. sometimes this happens because the generation kwargs are not correctly set. Please make sure that the generation kwargs are set correctly, or review your training hyperparameters.

2- UserWarning: The average ratio of batch (20.09) exceeds threshold 10.00. Skipping batch.
